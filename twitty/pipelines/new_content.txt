"The truth is I am what the world looks like. You are what the world looks like. In order for our systems to reflect that, they don't have to create a new reality. They just have to stop resisting the one we already live in." @AmericaFerrera #TED2019
"It's possible to be the person who genuinely wants to see change while also being the person whose actions keep things the way they are. Change isn't going to come by identifying the good guys &amp; the bad guys, because most of us are neither one of those." @AmericaFerrera #TED2019
"Real Women Have Curves was a critical, cultural and financial success. 'Great,' I thought. 'We did it! We proved our stories have value. Things are going to change now.' But I watched as very little happened. There was no watershed." @AmericaFerrera #TED2019
"Most days pass in an unmemorable flow, but, every once in a while, something delights you and you are forever after entranced." @nytdavidbrooks #TED2019

"It‚Äôs important that I tell you what this projection of heroism and expectation of constant gratitude does to people who are trying to recover. Because being cured is not where the work of healing ends, it‚Äôs where it begins." @suleikajaouad #TED2019
"The hardest part of my cancer experience began once the cancer was gone. That heroic journey of the survivor we see on movies &amp; watch on Instagram, it's a myth. it's not just untrue, it's dangerous, because it erases the very real challenges of recovery." @suleikajaouad #TED2019
"If you have never practiced critical thinking, then you simply see what you are told to see... A lot of people think that humans inherently know what is right and wrong... I tell them BS. Everything must be taught, including compassion." @YeonmiParkNK #TED2019

"Market liberalism tells us we are masters beholden to none, but then it enslaves us in the awful isolation of consumerism and status anxiety. Millions of us are onto the con now. We are realizing that a free-for-all is not the same as freedom for all." @ericpliu #TED2019
"To speak of 'civic religion' as religion is not poetic license. Democracy is one of the most faith-fueled human activities there is. Democracy works only when enough of us believe democracy works. It is both a gamble and a miracle."  @ericpliu #TED2019
"I remain hopeful. I don't mean optimistic. Optimism is for spectators. Hope implies agency; it says I have a hand in the outcome." @ericpliu on his faith in democracy #TED2019

"Animals can care very deeply for each other, maybe they even love each other, and when they do, a survivor's heart can be pierced by a death. If we recognize [animal grief], we can make the world a better, kinder place for animals." @bjkingape #TED2019
"Human connection is as threatened by unhealthy peace as by unhealthy conflict." Instead of avoiding controversial topics at your next gathering, @priyaparker recommends encouraging them with conditions in place to facilitate meaningful connection. #TED2019
"Let's make it easier for people to have babies. In order to invest in our future, we actually have to invest in our present and help those people who want to become parents. Give them affordable health care, child care, paid parental leave." @WajahatAli #TED2019

‚ÄúWasting time‚Äù on mindless activities can actually help your brain thrive. 

What do you do during your downtime to recharge your creativity?
Learn more about being a productive time-waster in our new TED Book, In Praise of Wasting Time, by Alan Lightman:  
‚ÄúDowntime is when we can ponder our past and imagine our future. ‚ÄòWasting time‚Äô is far from immoral uselessness. It may be the most important occupation of our minds,‚Äù says scientist and @TEDBooks author Alan Lightman.
Gertrude Stein took writing breaks to wander the countryside looking at cows. Gustav Mahler went on three-hour walks after lunch, stopping to jot down ideas in his notebook. Federico Fellini would wake up at 6am to walk about the house, open windows, and move books around.
Taking time to mediate allows you to follow your thoughts in an unhurried way and weave a narrative of who you are and what you believe in. It‚Äôs worth taking time to distance yourself from the rush of the world.
Simply letting your mind wander and embracing free-floating thoughts lights up different parts of your brain and could inspire creativity.
Does planning every second of your day make you less creative? 

Scientist and @TEDBooks author Alan Lightman makes the case for doing nothing more often as a way to refresh your mind. Here‚Äôs why you should prioritize some downtime.
By not giving ourselves the minutes ‚Äî or hours ‚Äî free of devices and distractions, we risk losing our ability to know who we are and what‚Äôs important to us.

Humans have escaped the bounds of natural selection, making us an ‚Äúoutbreak‚Äù species. Are we really special enough to be the rare species that doesn‚Äôt collapse? We need to use our shared knowledge to prep for our long-term survival, says @CharlesCMann #TED2018
The worst effects of climate change may not be felt for centuries. So how should we think about it now?  
Bottom trawling is the most destructive practice in the world. The nets of the largest fishing boats are so big that they could hold a dozen 747 airplanes. @Enric_Sala #TED2018 
You may soon find airplane options in your ride-sharing apps as flight becomes quieter, more agile and more affordable. Would you skip the traffic in this @VahanaAero? #TED2018 @RodinLyasoff

"Problems that affect future generations are often hugely neglected because future people don‚Äôt have a vote. It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs a lobby representing the interests of those born in 2300 AD. They don‚Äôt get to impact the decisions we make today." @willmacaskill #TED2018
‚ÄúSpace is vast, identifying a signal is hard, and we haven‚Äôt been looking that long. Without doubt, we should be spending more on the search. It‚Äôs about identifying our place in the universe." @stephenswebb on why we should search for aliens #TED2018

"This is the farthest thing from marketable art. It‚Äôs huge, it‚Äôs dangerous, it takes a dozen people to run and it doesn't go with the sofa. It‚Äôs beautifully crafted and completely useless." Nora Atkinson on "Charon" and the art of Burning Man #TED2018 
@FreeReyes @TheAudaciousPrj @TEDchris We're so sorry for the technical difficulties! We will be posting the session in full shortly on our Facebook Watch page:

If superintelligence arrives, who should be in control? @tegmark #TED2018

"We cannot have a society in which, if two people wish to communicate, the only way that can happen is through a third person who wishes to manipulate them." Jaron Lanier on why Google and Facebook need to change their business model #TED2018
Would you pay to use Facebook if it meant you could protect and own your data? #TED2018
Tech companies had an idealistic vision of the Internet as free and accessible to everyone, despite no businesses operating that way. Jaron Lanier suggests that's how users themselves became the product of social media‚Äî and why we should consider paying for Facebook. #TED2018

There are 200 million cases of malaria in Africa every year, and half a million deaths. @FaithOsier studies people who get infected but don't get sick to figure out how we could finally make a good vaccine. #TED2018

@beclarke @jkhoey We encourage anyone who believes an event isn't reflecting TED's values to email tedx@ted.com. We would definitely like to know and help out.

@kjhass Thank you, we really appreciate that.
@KatieMStack We're sorry to hear that. Ideas that matter are often sticky business :) If everyone agreed, sharing wouldn't be so important.
@naomiporper This is actually a misrepresentation of our views, but you can find our response here: 
@rbraceysherman Haha others seem to be suggesting you too! Sounds like a strong nomination :)
@theurv You can nominate her here: 
@KentPitman Our conferences are only held a couple times a year, but this issue is definitely on our radar.
@gardentraveler @laurenarankin And it's true that we don't have talks on abortion at the moment, but we certainly do welcome them.
@gardentraveler @laurenarankin That list was just meant to show our longstanding commitment to highlighting women's rights issues.
@WentRogue @rbraceysherman @JessicaValenti But we do recognize it as a human rights issue and believe it does have a place on our stage.
@WentRogue @rbraceysherman @JessicaValenti That is certainly not our intention. Jessica is right that we don't have talks on abortion.
@beingbrina @rbraceysherman @ilyseh You know, this convo has us asking the same question. There's no policy, but it's clearly a blind spot.
@ilyseh Thank you, Ilyse. We really appreciate your thoughtful questions.
@rbraceysherman @ilyseh Either of those would work well. We don't host political debates, but the ideas around the issues are all fair game.
@rbraceysherman That's an excellent topic suggestion. If you know someone who would be a great speaker on that topic, nominate them.
@rbraceysherman And we're always looking for more women. It's really hard to get women to agree to speak, so we need a lot of female noms.
@rbraceysherman We try to have a balance of topics, but there are a lot of topics to cover. We're always looking for great new speakers.
@rbraceysherman We have a curation team that reviews nominations and scours the world for interesting people.
@morgmeneshets @rbraceysherman That kind of real conversation, beyond the rhetoric and the agenda, would be perfect for our stage.
@rbraceysherman @KatieMStack Here's where we take speaker noms:  &amp; we promise it's more fun than being a tribute :)
@KTravisBallie @rbraceysherman If you do this and gather them in one place, send us a link. We'd love to see it.

@EmilySDouglas @NARAL Kelly meant the company wouldn't take a stance, but we would certainly cover it. Our response: 
@ilyseh @NARAL Yes, for sure. It's true that we don't have any talks on abortion atm, but we would welcome smart talks on the topic.
@matttbastard @NARAL @ilyseh We welcome nominations for great speakers on abortion and repro rights issues:
